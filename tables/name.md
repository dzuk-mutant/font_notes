This table basically contains font metadata. Some of them are absolutely required for proper functioning.

Each piece of metadata is identifiable by a particular number.

### Encoding

Each piece of metadata needs to be attached to platform IDs. If there are multiple platform IDs, then each piece of metadata has to be repeated, each with the different platform ID information.

### Metadata

In this case what's required (shown in 'req.') may not be strictly technically required, but some OSes or applications might reject it if you don't, so you really should.

1. 5 should begin with 'Version', you can add more detail, like release date, just separate them with commas.
2. 6 has to be restricted to 'printable' ASCII characters. (U+0021 through U+007E, and not '[', ']', '(', ')', '{', '}', '<', '>', '/', and '%'.)
3. URLs have to contain the protocol (ie. http://, ftp://, mailto:).
4. 'License' should just have a brief summary of the license, not legalese. Use 'License URL' to direct people to the legalese.
5. 1 and 2 are similar to 16 and 17 but not identical. 1 and 2 are legacy versions and are strictly restricted to 'Regular', 'Italic', 'Bold' and 'Bold Italic'. With 16 and 17 you can put whatever you want in them. If an application supports 16 and 17, they will take precedence over 1 and 2. If it doesn't, it will just use 1 and 2.
